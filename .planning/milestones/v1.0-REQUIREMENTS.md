## Out of Scope

| Feature                         | Reason                                        |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Static site generation          | Moving to SSR for instant content updates     |
| Webhook rebuild triggers        | Not needed with dynamic fetching              |
| Embedded Studio in SvelteKit    | Using Sanity's hosted studio, simpler setup   |
| Real-time collaborative editing | Single author workflow, adds complexity       |
| Multiple datasets               | Personal blog, single dataset sufficient      |
| Newsletter integration          | Can be added later, not part of CMS migration |
| Comments system                 | Not part of current site                      |
| Site redesign                   | Backend/CMS change only                       |

![Vercel Deploy](https://deploy-badge.vercel.app/vercel/maxdaten-io)

This is the source code for my personal website, [maxdaten.io](https://maxdaten.io). Driven by the
f\*\*\* awesome
[sveltekit-static-blog-template](https://github.com/matfantinel/sveltekit-static-blog-template).
It's built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), and uses [MDsveX](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/) to
allow using Svelte components inside Markdown files.

## Building & Running Locally

To run it locally, you simply have to run:

```shell
# First, install dependencies
npm install
# Then, run it on dev mode
npm run dev
```

The site should now be available at http://localhost:5173/ on your local machine, and your local
machine's IP address on your networkâ€”great for testing on mobile OSes.

## Managing Posts

All posts are Markdown files that are processed with [MDsveX](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/) to allow
using Svelte components inside them. In order to make it easier to manage posts, I highly recommend
the [Front Matter VS Code extension](https://frontmatter.codes/), which gives you a nice CMS-like
UI.
